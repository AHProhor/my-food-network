        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Gordon James Ramsay a British chef, restaurateur, television
          personality and writer. I was was born in Johnstone, Scotland, and
          raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. I founded my global restaurant
          group, Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, in 1997. It has been awarded 16
          Michelin stars in total and currently holds a total of seven. After
          rising to fame on the British television miniseries Boiling Point in
          1999, I had become one of the best-known and most influential chefs in
          the UK by 2004.
